This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

The best way to test the page is by going to https://2d-to-3d-shoe-webapp.vercel.app/

If you'd like to run the site on your local machine read below. You will need nodejs and run

```
npm i 
```

in the folder where this README is, then follow commands below

Getting Started
First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
